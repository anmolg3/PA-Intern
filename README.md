Problem -
The use of provisioned capacity is not a lot and the company ends up paying money for the time it is not using the load, as well as pay extra amount when load exceeds provisioned load.

To solve this, a graph between provisioned load and cost can be made. And studing that graph can give us the insights regarding cost vs load.



In the code, variable y is the actual load, which I believe is not real load which is why the answer is coming out to be increasing. In reality there will be lot mor data points in the whole day and then using this code some meaningful results can be drawn.

The code is written in python in google colab. Please upload the data file before running the program.
